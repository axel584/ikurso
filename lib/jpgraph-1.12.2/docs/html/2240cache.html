<H1><A NAME="5">5 Understanding the JpGraph caching system</A></H1>
 To reduce load on the web server JpGraph implements an advanced caching
 system which avoids the burden of always having to run the full image
 script.
<P> Depending on the complexity of the image script (for example if it
 is doing several DB lookups) this could significantly improve
 performance.</P>
<P> The rationale behind this is of course performance, and the
 observation that very few graphs are really real-time, i.e. needs to be
 updated absolutely every time the graphing script is called.</P>
<P></P>
<H2><A NAME="5_1">5.1 Enabling the cache system</A></H2>
 The enabling disabling of the cache system is controlled by two defines
 (in jpgraph.php)
<P>

</CODE></B></DIV></P>
<P></P>
<P> The first of these, USE_CACHE, is the master-switch which must be
 set to true to enable the caching system. The second switch READ_CACHE
 very seldom needs to be changed.</P>
<P> This second switch basically tells whether or not JpGraph should
 ever look in the cache. Setting this to false and the master-switch to
 true would then always generate an new updated image file in the cache
 and this new image woudl be send back to the browser. The main use for
 this (admittedly) strange setting is if you like to have the side
 effect of the script that a fresh image is always stored in the cache
 directory.</P>
<P> Once you have enabled the cache you must also make sure that a valid
 cache directory is setup. The cache directory is specified with the
 define</P>

color="#0000CC"></FONT></FONT></CODE></B></DIV></P>
<P></P>
<P> You can of course change the default directory to whatever directory
 you fancy. But, you must remember one important thing.<STRONG> The
 cache directory must be writable for the user running Apache/PHP</STRONG>
.</P>
<H2><A NAME="5_2">5.2 Using the cache in your script</A></H2>
 To use caching in your script you must supply a suitable file name
 which will be used to store the image in the cache. You can also supply
 a timeout value indicating how many minutes the cached image should be
 considered valid.
<P> These parameters are supplied in the initial Graph() method call
 which should be among the first in your script. Instead of manually
 specifying a file name to be used you could often use the special name
 &quot;auto&quot;. If the filename is specified as &quot;auto&quot; the cashed image will
 then be named the same as the image script but with the correct
 extension depending on what image format have been chosen.</P>
<P> If you don't specify a file name no caching will be used no matter
 the settings of USE_CACHE (without a file name it is impossible!)</P>
<P> The following call to Graph() shows a typical use of the cache.</P>
<P>
<BR> &nbsp;
<BR><DIV style="background-color:#E6E6E6;font-family:courier new;font-size:85%;font-weight:bold;">

)</FONT><FONT color="#0000CC"></FONT></FONT></CODE></B></DIV></P>
<P></P>
<P> The above code will use the automatic filename and a make the cache
 valid for 60 minutes.</P>
<P> So, how does this all work now?</P>
<P> The first time you call your script (no cached image) everything
 will be as usual, the script will run and you will in the end send back
 the image to the browser. However if you have the caching enabled
 JpGraph will automatically have stored a copy of the generated image in
 the cache directory.</P>
<P> The next time you call the script the first thing that happens in
 the initial Graph() is that it will go and check in the cache directory
 if the named image exists there. If this is the case it will also
 checks that the image isn't too old (as compared to the specified
 timeout value). If the image is valid then the image will be streamed
 straight back from the image file to the browser and the script will
 end it's execution.</P>
<P> Hence, if the image is found in the cache<STRONG> no code lines
 after the initial Graph() call will be executed</STRONG></P>
<P> The design decision behind this is that your image script code never
 has to include anything special to make full use of the cache. It will
 just automatically work.</P>
<H2><A NAME="5_3">5.3 Using the cache with Client Side Image Maps</A></H2>
 You can also use the cache system for CSIM as well. The cache system
 interface is slightly different in this case since the cache needs to
 store<STRONG> both</STRONG> the cached image and the cached image-map.
 It also needs to change due to the way CSIM HTML paradigm work. The two
 major differences from the &quot;standard&quot; cache is
<OL>
<LI> The cached version will<STRONG> not</STRONG> be stored in the
 previous defined cache directory. See more below.</LI>
<LI> You must call an extra method, CheckCSIMCache(), to check the
 cache, see more below.</LI>
</OL>
<P> The performace benefits even for simple CSIM images is around 50% if
 the cache can be used and can of course be several 1000% if
 construction of the image requires DB calls and other complex
 operations which can be avoided.</P>
<P> Before reading further you should have an understanding on how the
 CSIM works by reading the section &quot;<A href="6csimdoc.html">Using Client
 side image maps</A>&quot;.</P>
<P> Please remember that when using CSIM you must end your script with a
 call to<A href=""> Graph::StrokeCSIM()</A> method insetad of the<A href="">
 Graph::Stroke()</A> used for non-csim.</P>
<P> To use the cache with CSIM you have to call the<A href="">
 Graph::CheckCSIMCache()</A>. As with the caching for non-CSIM you have
 to supply a name to be used for the cached version as well as an
 optional timeout value. The default timeout value if nothing else is
 specified is 60 minutes.</P>
<P> The name argument requires some more explanations. You must specify
 a relative name here. For example &quot;myimage&quot; or perhaps
 &quot;firstpage/image3&quot;. Depending on your installation of JpGraph this will
 now end up in the directory specified in the CSIMCACHE_DIR define. This
 must also be a directory accessible by the normal web server. By
 default a directory called &quot;csimcache&quot; will be created in the same
 directory as the image script itself.</P>
<P> This has the drawback that the directory from where the script is
 executed must be writeable by the process running PHP. Best practice
 for this is to keep the number of writeable directory for PHP down to a
 minimum and re-use the same directory as is used for the standard
 cache. This however, require that your system administrator setup that
 cache directory so that it also accessible by the HTTP server from the
 htdocs root.</P>
<P> The CheckCSIMCache() method checks the cache for an existing cached
 version and if found it returns it and halts execution of the script.
 So, this call should be the first call after the creation of the
 Graph() and before any heavy work is done to create the image so that
 you can minimize the execution of the script in the case a match is
 found.</P>
<P> So, the general structure of a script that uses CSIM and the cache
 is

<P> Please note that you<STRONG> do not</STRONG> need to pass any
 argument to the final call to StrokeCSIM() as you do when not using the
 cache.</P>
<HR> <SMALL><STRONG> Technical note:</STRONG> The CSIM caching works by
 storing two files in the cache directory. One file being the image and
 the other file being the corresponding image map as a pure HTML file.</SMALL>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="5_4">5.4 Some final comments</A></H2>
<UL>
<LI>If you want the timeout value to be &quot;forever&quot; then you can specify a
 0 as the timeout value (or leave the parameter blank). To regenerate
 the image you will have to remove the image files from the cache. This
 removal could for example be handled by a nightly cron-job</LI>
<LI> If you use images where you have enabled the anti-aliasing you
 should strongly consider using caching since anti-aliasing is quite
 time consuming compared to standard line drawings.</LI>
