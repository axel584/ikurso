<H2><A NAME="11_1">11.1 Anti-aliasing in JpGraph</A></H2>
 From version 1.2 JpGraph supports drawing of anti-aliased lines. There
 are a few caveats in order to use this which is discussed in this
 section.
<P></P>
<HR> <SMALL><STRONG> Sidebar</STRONG> Note that anti-alising will not be
 used for either horizontal, vertical or 45 degree lines since they are
 by their nature are sampled at adequate rate.</SMALL>
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="11_1_1">11.1.1 Enabling anti-aliased lines</A></H3>
 Anti-aliased lines are enabled by calling the method<A href="../ref/Image.html#_IMAGE_SETANTIALIASING">
 SetAntiAliasing()</A> in the<A href="../ref/Image.html#_C_IMAGE"> Image
 class</A> in the script where you want to use anti-aliasing.
<P> The anti-aliasing for lines works by &quot;smoothing&quot; out the edges on
 the line by using a progressive scale of colors interpolated between
 the background color and the line color.</P>
<P></P>
<HR> <SMALL><STRONG> Sidenote:</STRONG> The algorithm used for
 anti-aliasing of lines is quite simple. It would be possible to achieve
 even better result by doing some real 2D signal processing. However,
 doing real time 2D signal processing on a HTTP server would be madness
 so I deliberately kept it simple. To achieve best visual result always
 use a dark line color on a light background.</SMALL>
<HR>
<P> An example will show that this, quite simple algorithm, gives a
 reasonable good result. The figures below shows a radar plot with and
 without anti-aliasing.</P>

<P> One thing you need to keep in mind when deciding to use
 anti-aliasing is that it could have potentially a dramatic effect on
 the time it takes to generate the image. Line drawing with
 anti-aliasing turned on is roughly 8 times slower than the normal line
 drawing so treat this feature wisely.</P>
<P> Furthermore there are a couple of &quot;gotchas&quot; you should be aware of
 when using anti-aliasing.</P>
<OL>
<LI> Anti-aliased lines uses up more of the available color-palette. The
 exact number of colors used is dependent on the line-angle, a near
 horizontal or near vertical line uses more colors (number of lines with
 different angles uses more colors). Hence it might not be possible to
 use anti-aliasing with color-gradient fill since the number of
 available colors in the palette might not be enough. A normal palette
 can keep around 256 colors. This means that you are advised to use a
 truecolor image when using anti-aliasing.</LI>
<LI> Anti-aliasing does not work very well together with background
 images since it assumes a the same solid color on each side of the
 line. Doing a more advanced anti-aliasing algorithm would simple take
 to much processing power.</LI>
<LI>Anti-aliased lines will ignore the line width specified. They will
 always have a width of roughly 1.</LI>
</OL>
<H2><A NAME="11_2">11.2 Rotating the graphs</A></H2>
 JpGraph provide the possibility for you to rotate the generated graph
 an arbitrary angle. This will only affect the actual graph (axis, axis
 titles, labels and so on) and not fixed elements on the graph like
 title or footer.
<P> Rotation is probably most used to rotate a graph 90 degrees, for
 example a bar graph to get the effect of horizontal bars.</P>
<P></P>
<HR> <SMALL><STRONG> Performance note:</STRONG> Adding a rotation
 transformation will make the graph generation slightly slower since
 each point of the graph as to go through a transformation step before
 being stroked on to the image. JpGraph optimises this by using a
 pre-calculated transformation matrice and also optimises the special
 case 90 degrees.</SMALL>
<HR>
<P> By default the center of the rotation will be the center of the plot
 area, which may or may not coincide with the center of the entire
 image.</P>
<P> To control the rotation you use the two methods</P>
<UL>
<LI><A href="../ref/RotImage.html#_ROTIMAGE_SETANGLE">
 Graph::image::SetAngle()</A>, Specify rotation angle in degrees.</LI>
<LI><A href="../ref/RotImage.html#_ROTIMAGE_SETCENTER">
 Graph::image::SetCenter()</A>, Specify center of rotation in absolute
 image pixels</LI>
</UL>
 For example
<BR> &nbsp;
<BR><DIV style="background-color:#E6E6E6;font-family:courier new;font-size:85%;font-weight:bold;">

45</FONT><FONT color="#006600">);</FONT><FONT color="#0000CC"></FONT></FONT>
</CODE></B></DIV>
<P></P>
<P> There is actually a third method that you could use, adding a
 translation to the graph<STRONG> after</STRONG> the rotation. Since
 this probably a very little used method we don't discuss it further but
 refer the reader to the class reference instead<A href="../ref/RotImage.html#_ROTIMAGE_SETTRANSLATION">
 Graph:image::SetTranslation()</A></P>
<P> When you rotate an image you should be aware of that the individual
 labels on the axis are not rotated. The design decision behind this is
<BR><STRONG> a)</STRONG> Bit mapped font can't be rotated
<BR><STRONG> b)</STRONG> Maintain readability</P>
<P> Please remember that you may still rotate the labels by calling the<A
href="../ref/Axis.html#_AXIS_SETLABELANGLE"> Axis::SetLabelAngle()</A>
 method.</P>
<P> Since the anchor point for labels is by default the optimum for
 graph at 0 degree you might want to adjust the anchor point and
 alignment for the labels on the axis to get a better visual appearance
 on you rotated graph. This is accomplished by the method<A href="../ref/Axis.html#_AXIS_SETLABELALIGN">
 Axis::SetLabelAlign()</A> For a detailed discussion on how to do this
 please see the section on horizontal bar graphs, (<A href="3030barplot.html">
 Working with bar plots</A> )</P>
<P> The table below shows some examples on different kinds of rotation
 to give you an idea of how changing the angle and rotation center may
 be used to generate different effects. The top left graph is the
 original image. The point of rotation has been marked with a red-cross
 in each of the images.</P>

</TABLE>
 As you can see from the images above if you rotate about any other
 point than the center of the plot area the plot can be placed outside
 the image after rotation.
<P> Since the rotation, by design, only affects the plot area it is
 often most effective to use when the color of the margin is the same as
 the background color.</P>
<H2><A NAME="11_3">11.3 Adjusting brightness and contrast for images and
 backgrounds</A></H2>
 It is often desirable to have a background image look a little bit
 &quot;washed&quot; out so it doesn't take the concentration away from the actual
 graph. There are basically two ways of accomplish this
<OL>
<LI> Prepare the image with an external images editor to adjust the
 level of brightnes and contrasty to a desirable level</LI>
<LI> Use JpGraph:s built int adjustment for contrast, brightness and
 color saturation.</LI>
</OL>
 To adjust the background image call The levels for both brightness and
 constrast are real numbers in the range [-1, 1] You can choose to
 adjust for example just the background image or you might also choose
 to adjust the whole image. To change the background image just use the
 method<A href="../ref/Graph.html#_GRAPH_ADJBACKGROUNDIMAGE">
 Graph::AdjBackgroundImage()</A> to specify a suitable value. Let's show
 some example on what we can do with this. The following example have
 been generated by using the small utility &quot;adjimg.php&quot; which you can
 find in the &quot;utils/&quot; directory.

<H2><A NAME="11_4">11.4 Timing the generation of graphs</A></H2>
 During development and optimization it can be very handy to have the
 actual time it took to generate the image as a footnote. The following
 example shows the usage of this feature
<P><DIV align="center">
<BR><A href="exframes/frame_example11.html"> <IMG border="0" HEIGHT="200"
 src="img/example11.png" WIDTH="300"></A>
<BR><SMALL><EM><B>Figure 9:</B> Timing of a graph<A href="exframes/frame_example11.html">
 [src]</A></EM></SMALL></DIV></P>
<P> To enable this feature you can proceed in two ways.</P>
<OL>
<LI> You can either set the global define BRAND_TIMIING (in jpgraph.php)
 to true. This will add the timing string to all graphs generated.</LI>
<LI> .. or you can enable it for a specific graph by setting the global
 variable $gJpgBrandTiming as in
<BR> &nbsp;
<BR><DIV style="background-color:#E6E6E6;font-family:courier new;font-size:85%;font-weight:bold;">
<B><CODE><FONT color="#000000"><FONT color="#0000CC"> $gJpgBrandTiming</FONT><FONT
color="#006600">=</FONT><FONT color="#0000CC">true</FONT><FONT color="#006600">
;</FONT><FONT color="#0000CC"></FONT></FONT></CODE></B></DIV></LI>
<P> in the beginning of the script.</P>
</OL>
 If you like you might also change the way the timing is formatted by
 setting the string defined by BRAND_TIMING_FORMAT (in jpgraph.php).
 This string represents a standard printf() format string.
<HR> <SMALL><STRONG> Sidenote:</STRONG> JpGraph contains a utility class
 called JpgTimer which you can use yourself should you need ms timing of
 part of your own code. The API is really simple. The class supports
 multiple running timers and you start a timer simply by calling the
 Push() method. This will start a new timer and put it on the top of the
 timer stack. To stop the timer, pop it from the stack and return the
 timing value simply call Pop().</SMALL>
